            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>Compain was founded in 2014 by a group of engineers who wanted to break the rules of conventional auto products. They started with a simple product – Blinker Fluid™ – and never looked back. Since then, Compain has been dedicated to creating the most innovative (and sometimes bizarre) auto accessories the world has ever seen. We’re proud to be the go-to brand for anyone who loves quirky, high-quality products that stand out from the crowd.</p>
